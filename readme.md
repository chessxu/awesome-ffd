## Introduction

This is a list of awesome method used in face forgery detection, as well as a collection of plug and play modules. Due to limited ability and energy, many modules may not be included. If you have any suggestions or improvements, welcome to submit an [issue](https://github.com/chessxu/awesome-ffd/issues).
